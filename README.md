Adaptation of my TinyTetris (on codebender.cc and hackster.io):

At the moment it runs, has background music and a splash screen.
It looks for a "Tinytris" folder on the SD card with inside a "music.raw" file.
Three alternatives music are available, choose the one you like most and rename it music.raw

Music is a personal arrangement, made with Garageband, derived from a classic "Korobeiniki" (Russian: Коробейники) midi file.

**Help**

- Joystick moves pieces left + right + down=fast
- Buttons rotate in two directions (right button is "classic" top-goes-right rotation)

**Push the 2 buttons together** to reset the game and toggle blocks size. Larger blocks are easier to see but leave less vertical space to play.


**Possible extensions**

- Hi scores +prefs on µSD: at the moment a blank prefs file is saved inside the app folder
- a global options menu (start, pause, restart, mute effects, mute music, change size, show scores)
