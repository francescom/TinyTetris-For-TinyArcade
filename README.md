At the moment it runs. Without audio and without bitmaps.
I plan to add a splash screen (already drawn) and some audio music (like original or digitized)

Possible extensions
Hi scores +prefs on ÂµSD
Moves/drops audio effects
a global menu (start, pause, restart, mute effects, mute music, change size, show scores)
