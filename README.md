# Tinytris-For-TinyArcade

Adaptation of my TinyTetris (on codebender.cc and hackster.io):

for the TinyArcade:

At the moment it runs, has background music and a splash screen.
It looks for a "Tinytris" folder on the SD card with inside a "music.raw" file.
Three alternatives music are available, choose the one you like most and rename it music.raw


**Help**

Push the 2 buttons together to reset the game and toggle blocks size. Larger blocks are easier to see but leave less vertical space to play.


Possible extensions

- Hi scores +prefs on µSD: at the moment a blank prefs file is saved inside the app folder
- a global options menu (start, pause, restart, mute effects, mute music, change size, show scores)
